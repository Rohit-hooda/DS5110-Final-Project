# DS5110-Final-Project
The main objective of this project is to build a robust data integration pipeline that merges data from multiple sources into a consistent and unified format. This process will ensure that the gathered data is structured and ready for analysis. Once the data is properly integrated, the next step will be to develop a weather prediction model using relevant algorithms and techniques. The final component of the project involves visualizing the prediction results through interactive charts, which will be displayed on a user-friendly website, allowing users to easily interpret and understand the weather forecasts.
